# Data Sets & Problem Solutions

The most important thing I've learned when following a CS course is to **keep your feet wet**.
Listening, thinking, coding, coding...
```
while (life = true):
    coding
```

My solutions to problems from ROSALIND, Books, and courses I have taken. Also some data sets are included.
